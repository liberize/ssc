# Call a bundled interpreter

We can bundle the interpreter and all it's dependencies along with our binary.

To call the bundled interpreter, use a shebang with relative path.

## Example: bash-static

`bash-static` is a static build of bash. It doesn't come with any dependencies, so it's suitable to be distributed along with the binary.

```bash
# download bash-static
wget https://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/bash/bash-static_5.2.15-2+b2_amd64.deb
ar x bash-static_5.2.15-2+b2_amd64.deb data.tar.xz
tar -xvf data.tar.xz ./bin/bash-static
mv ./bin/bash-static ./
rm -rf ./bin data.tar.xz bash-static_5.2.15-2+b2_amd64.deb

# use -s flag to make a static binary
../../ssc ./test_bash_static.sh binary -s

# create tarball (or AppImage if you like)
chmod +x binary bash-static
tar -zcvf release.tar.gz binary bash-static
```

## Example: busybox

`busybox` provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file. We can make a completely dependency-free binary with it.

```bash
# download busybox-static
wget https://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/busybox/busybox-static_1.35.0-4+b3_amd64.deb
ar x busybox-static_1.35.0-4+b3_amd64.deb data.tar.xz
tar -xvf data.tar.xz ./bin/busybox
mv ./bin/busybox ./
rm -rf ./bin data.tar.xz busybox-static_1.35.0-4+b3_amd64.deb data.tar.xz

# use -s flag to make a static binary
../../ssc ./test_busybox.sh binary -s

# create tarball (or AppImage if you like)
chmod +x binary busybox
tar -zcvf release.tar.gz binary busybox
```
